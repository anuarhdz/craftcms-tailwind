# Craft CMS 4 Foundation

## Getting started

Run `composer create-project heyblackmagic/foundation ./PATH` to create your Craft CMS instance.

## Setup

After installing and configuring your Craft CMS instance, set the ./public_html directory as the project webroot. For example, if your virtual host is "<http://foundation.test>", run the following in your terminal:

```zsh
~/Sites/foundation main
❯ cd public && valet link foundation
```

## IMPORTANT

Your project URL, whether local, staging or production, MUST NOT include a trailing slash. Check that the `PRIMARY_SITE_URL` y `VITE_DEV_URL` variable in the `.env` follows this recommendation.

Example:
❌
<http://foundation.test/>

✅
<https://foundation.test>

## Command reference

- Run `npm run dev` to watch files to start development.
- Run `npm run build` to build assets.
